*** Guessing game ***

## Game goal and description
Find two pages that have coordinates. The user must guess which one is further north.

## Walkthrough - step-by-step of game progress
1. The game begins by explaining to the player the rules of the game, how you collect points.
2. The game presents to the user two different Wikipedia article titles, probably landmarks or cities.
   (Depends on how we can get the information from wikipedia based on categories.)
3. The game asks the user, which of these two things is further north.
4. The user gives an answer 1 or 2
5. The game tells if the answer is correct or not

6. Repeat the above X times

7. Give final score to the player Y right answers out of X

## Tasks (functions) Monday
David: get page with coordinates (Done)

Jukka: given two coordinates, which one is further north. Check the input parameters. (Done)
       Return None, if the given input was not valid.
       Return 0 if the first input was more north, 1 if the second

David: present article names to the user with the question, which is further north? (Done)

Suyanthan: introducing the game (Done)
Karuvan: getting user input in a robust way, accepting only number 1 or 2
Suyanthan: given coordinates, calculate the distance between the places (bonus) (Done)

## Tasks Tuesday

Jukka: investigate how we could get others to run the code from the shared folder
Jukka: define a function... When you give it page title or id, it returns a short description of the place.

Karuvan/Suyanthan: finding my possition lat, lon
Nikita: how to find what lat, lon(pos) is gloser to a lat, log(pos)

## Tasks Wednesday

### To discuss

1. I was reading the documentation to understand the geolocator. If I understand correctly,
this line could have "user_agent=Guessipedia". The docu is asking who is calling the
geolocator service.
I am impressed you found geopy to do this!
geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent=address)
I added a unit test for the function. It works great when it finds a place on earth that is even close to
what input the user gave. (DONE)

2. David: If I give "lkeang lksb√∂lkwn lke lk<smg"  as my location, I get an error message that my location is not found
but I don't get a chance to give another location 
It results in an error later because in this case the function returns "None". (DONE)

3. David: The question "which is further distance" wasn't clear to me first.
   Can we modify the code to ask "Which is further distance from you?" (DONE)

4. David: Shall we add names of players (done)

5. David: Wrong answers in red color and add color elsewhere as well. (DONE)

6. Jukka: Would be nice if the user got a message "Your coordinates are x deg North, y deg East" ()
          And also show where you are on the map.

7. David: Would be nice if after giving the answer, the message would include what the distance was between the player
and the locations. (DONE)

8. David: Would be nice, if after giving the answer, the user would learn the positions of the two locations and how
many degrees and kilometers further north, east or west the positions were (DONE)

9. Jukka: Start with the presentation (Done)

10. The main function is getting long. Maybe we can break it a bit into separate functions?
